    <h1>OFC Network Design & Laying</h1>
    <p>
      OFC — or Optical Fiber Communication — underpins the digital framework of
      the modern urban network. Winsome’s fiber-optic network design focuses on
      support of increasing bandwidth requirements in carrier and enterprise
      fiber-optic networks. From fiber optic cable to DWDM, ROADM, and packet
      optical transport platforms, fiber-optic network design technology
      continues to find a home in mobile backhaul, cloud services, data center,
      and other highspeed network applications. Fiber optic network design
      refers to the specialized processes leading to successful installation and
      operation. OFC network design is important part of the HTMS solution. It
      provide a communication link that connects all the field equipment that
      are part of HTMS with each other and Central Control Room. The networking
      topology for designing the HTMS is hybrid in nature wherein ring, star and
      peer to peer mechanism considering the project length and site situation.
      Winsome always maintains a redundancy throughout the backbone without
      resulting in network data broadcasting storm.
