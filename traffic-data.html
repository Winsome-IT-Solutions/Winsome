    <h1>Traffic Data Collection</h1>
    <p>
      With hundreds of millions of vehicles — private, public and commercial —
      zipping by on Indian roads every single day, the need for macro as well as
      micro level data and its analysis has exploded. From businesses to
      governments, there is a massive requirement for yet faster delivery of
      information on vehicle volumes, freight movements, classification and
      operating characteristics on the geometric and structural design of
      roadways and bridges.
